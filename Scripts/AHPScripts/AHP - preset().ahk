; For the preset() function [Created by TaranVH] to work, you MUST go into Adobe Premiere's Keyboard Shortcuts panel,
; find the following commands, and add these keyboard shortcut assignments to them:
; 
; Ctrl +               B      Application > Select Find Box
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + K      Application > Shuttle Stop
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 1      Application > Window > Project         (Default is Shift + 1) (This sets the focus onto a BIN) 
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 3      Application > Window > Timeline        (Default is Shift + 3)
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 4      Application > Window > Program Monitor (Default is Shift + 4)
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 5      Application > Window > Effect Controls (Default is Shift + 5)
; Ctrl + Alt + Shift + 7      Application > Window > Effects         (Default is Shift + 7)
;
; Alternatively, you can add your pre-made keyboard shortcuts to Adobe Premiere.

; preset() is my most used, and most useful AHK function! There is no good reason why Premiere doesn't have this functionality.
;keep in mind, I use 150% UI scaling, so your pixel distances for commands like mousemove WILL be different!
;to use this script yourself, carefully go through  testing the script and changing the values, ensuring that the script works, one line at a time. use message boxes to check on variables and see where the cursor is. remove those message boxes later when you have it all working!
