# AHK

Download AHK here: https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases/download/v2.0.12/AutoHotkey_2.0.12_setup.exe

Please note that this AHK script is using V1.1. But Downloading AHK-v2 is still recommended since the script is still compatible.

Download the whole repo. Afterwards, place these files under C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\AHK

or

%appdata%

Add host.ahk to the startup folder.

Startup folder can be found here: C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp

or

shell:startup

Once you run the script, it'll show a prompt for the first time you use it, and it'll ask you to download AHK v1.1.37.02. Click yes.
