# AHK

Download AHK here: https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey/releases/download/v2.0.12/AutoHotkey_2.0.12_setup.exe

Please note that this AHK script is using V1.1. But downloading AHK-v2 is still recommended since the script is still compatible.

Download the whole repo. Afterwards, place these files under "C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\AHK" or %appdata%

Add host.ahk to the startup folder.

Startup folder can be found here: "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp" or shell:startup

Once you run the script, it'll show a prompt for the first time you use it, and it'll ask you to download AHK v1.1.37.02. Click yes.

Host.ahk has all the main scripts you execute using keyboard keybinds.

GUI/UserCommands.ahk has the scripts you execute using the CapsLock menu.

General.ahk and GUI.ahk can be ignored. Please do not change or move anything in those files if you don't know what you're doing.
