# Features

### CapsLock GUI

`CapsLock` becomes a small GUI that allows you to run any normal AutoHotkey command or block of code by typing a name for the command you want to run.

Normal `CapsLock` functionality is preserved, and can be toggled by `Alt + CapsLock`.


### Middle Mouse Button moves up a folder in Explorer

If you press on the `Middle Mouse Button`, you'll move up a folder in Windows Files explorer. This also works on "Open In" or Context Explorer windows.

### Windows Key + MouseScroll - Volume Control

If you hold down the Windows Key and use the scroll wheel of your mouse, you'll be able to control the volume of your PC.

### Switch Virtual Desktops Easily

By Using `Windows + Q` and `Windows + E`, you'll be able to switch through virtual desktops with ease.

### Use NumpadSubtract to Show Desktop

By pressing `NumpadSubtract`, you'll be able to hide or show open windows.

### Windows Key or Alt + Numpad Keys for Volume Control

Let's you control the volume of your PC by pressing `Windows or Alt + Numpad4/7/8` for Volume Up, Down, and Mute.

### Quickly Change Tab in Google Chrome

Using `F1` and `F2` lets you go to the previous or next tab.

### Toggle File Extensions and Hidden Files in File Explorer

Using `Windows + Y` toggles File Extensions in Windows Explorer. `Windows + H` toggles hidden files.

You can also use the `CapsLock` GUI by typing "ext" for File Extensions and "hid" for Hidden Files.

### Easily Insert Date and Time

`Windows + W` will send the current date and time with the format YYYY-MM-DD - HH:MM:SS.

`Windows + Shift + W` sends current date only.

### Replacing Insert Key as a Paste key

`Insert` will paste whatever you have in your clipboard.

### Disabling F1 Key in File Explorer and Google Chrome

Prevents you from opening the help and center page accidentally.
